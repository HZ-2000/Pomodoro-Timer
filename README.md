A web page with a journal style log and a pomodoro timer to help with productivity. The system works by sectioning your time into 25 minute chunks called
pomodoros, at the end of 25 minutes of focused work you have completed 1 pomodoro and get a 5 minute break. after 3 complete pomodoros you get a longer 30 minute break. The journal at the bottom is just a way to help you orginize your tasks so you know what you have left to do.
